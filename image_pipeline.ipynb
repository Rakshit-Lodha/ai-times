Ling-2.5-1T handles up to 1 million tokens and matches frontier thinking models while using just 5,890 tokens versus their typical 15,000-23,000. Ring-2.5-1T, the world's first hybrid linear-architecture thinking model, crushed advanced math competitions, scoring 35/42 on IMO 2025. They also dropped Ming-Flash-Omni-2.0, unifying speech, audio, and music. Open-sourcing trillion-parameter models could democratize cutting-edge AI capabilities and intensify pressure on closed competitors.\",\n",

This Mixture-of-Experts beast uses 256 experts with only 44B active per inference, trained on 28.5 trillion tokens with a 200K context window. It packs DeepSeek Sparse Attention for efficiency and a native Agent Mode that autonomously generates professional documents. Benchmarks show it rivals Gemini 3 Pro on coding tasks and approaches Claude Opus 4.5. As Western AI labs tighten control, China's bet on radical openness could reshape the entire AI development landscape and accelerate global innovation.\",\n",

The Palo Alto startup, founded by ex-Google Brain engineers Anna Goldie and Azalia Mirhoseini, is using AI to design AI chips, creating a recursive loop between models and hardware. Led by Lightspeed with backing from NVIDIA's VC arm, DST Global, and Sequoia, the round brings total funding to $335 million since their December 2025 seed. Their platform automates chip design from placement to verification, targeting semiconductor firms hungry for speed. If AI can design its own hardware, chip development cycles could shrink dramatically, potentially reshaping the semiconductor industry's economics and timelines.\",\n",

The model uses hybrid sparse Mixture-of-Experts with linear attention for blazing inference speeds and natively handles text, image, and video inputs. It supports 201 languages, offers a million-token context window via Qwen3.5-Plus, and runs 60% cheaper with 8x efficiency versus predecessors. Weights are live on HuggingFace and ModelScope.
