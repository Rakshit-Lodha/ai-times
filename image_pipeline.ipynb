    "  'output': \"Following SpaceX's acquisition of xAI—forming a $1.25 trillion entity—Musk has reorganized the AI company into four core teams: Grok (chatbot/voice led by Aman Madaan), Coding (Manuel Kroiss), Imagine multimedia (Guodong Zhang), and Macrohard for process automation (Toby Pohlen). The shake-up saw co-founders Tony Wu and Jimmy Ba resign, leaving six of twelve original co-founders. The restructuring aims to accelerate execution velocity as xAI scales toward a planned late-2026 IPO.\\n\\nThis streamlined structure could position xAI to compete more aggressively across chatbots, coding tools, and enterprise AI—especially with SpaceX's resources backing its ambitions.\",\n",

The company, founded in 2021 by former Spotify ML lead Erik Bernhardsson, specializes in AI inference infrastructure that cuts compute costs and speeds up model outputs.
