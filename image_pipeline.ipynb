Unlike traditional pattern-based scanners, it performs end-to-end analysis, traces data flows across components, scores severity automatically, and suggests fixes without applying them. The research preview is available now for Enterprise and Team customers, with expedited access for open-source maintainers. Security teams gain faster triage and developers get guided remediation, addressing a critical gap in enterprise and open-source security workflows as vulnerabilities grow more complex.',\n",
