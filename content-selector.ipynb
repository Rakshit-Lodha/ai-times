    "        NON-NEGOTIABLE AGGREGATION RULES:\n",
    "          1. DO NOT paraphrase, rewrite, summarize, shorten, or expand any selected item's `output`.\n",
    "          2. For each selected item, `output` must be copied EXACTLY from one raw `news_output` entry.\n",
    "          3. If combining duplicate stories, you may only:\n",
    "             - keep one `output` exactly as-is from one chosen base item\n",
    "             - append additional `sources` URLs from exact duplicates\n",
    "             - never synthesize or merge text across multiple outputs\n",
    "          4. If no exact duplicate exists, keep the item as a 1:1 copy.\n",
    "        \n",
    "       SELECTION CRITERIA (in priority order):\n",
    "        1. \"Would a working professional (PM, engineer, designer, marketer) share this in their team Slack?\" — \n",
    "        if yes, this story is HIGH priority regardless of category.\n",
    "        2. \"Does this change how someone works, builds, or makes decisions this week?\" — if yes, HIGH priority.\n",
    "        3. \"Is this just a funding announcement with no product or strategic insight?\" — \n",
    "        if yes, LOW priority. Only include if the round signals a major market shift (e.g., $1B+ rounds that reshape competitive dynamics).\n",
    "        4. Funding stories about companies most readers haven't heard of should almost never make the cut \n",
    "        unless the technology itself is breakthrough.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        BALANCE CHECK (soft):\n",
    "        After selecting your 15-16 stories, count the funding stories. \n",
    "        If more than 5 are pure funding with no product angle, drop the weakest ones and replace with stories from other categories.\n",

    "          Then you need to put it in a STRICT JSON which is as follows (not per-item only)\n",

    "          \n",
    "          ANTI-HALLUCINATION OUTPUT RULES (MANDATORY):\n",

    "             - \"id\" (integer) copied from input row\n",
    "             - \"news_date\" (YYYY-MM-DD) copied from input row\n",
    "             - \"output\" copied EXACTLY from that same row's `news_output`\n",
    "          2. Do not invent or transform ids, dates, outputs, or URLs.\n",
    "          3. \"sources\" must be built only from that row’s `source_urls` (or exact-duplicate rows if merged).\n",
