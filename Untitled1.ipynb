Davis, Kevin M. Foster, Aaron Jalca, Brent H. Meyer, Paul Mizen, Michael A. Navarrete, Pawel Smietanka, Gregory Thwaites, and Ben Zhe Wang; Issue Date February 2026. [Source: NBER, https://www.nber.org/papers/w34836] ([nber.org](https://www.nber.org/papers/w34836))\\n\\n- REPORT SNAPSHOT — Scope: geography, sectors, sample size, time window, method type: Almost 6,000 CFOs/CEOs/executives surveyed across the US, UK, Germany and Australia; cross-country, representative firm samples; outcomes assessed over the past 3 years with projected effects over the next 3 years; method = firm-level survey. [Source: NBER, https://www.nber.org/papers/w34836] ([nber.org](https://www.nber.org/papers/w34836))\\n\\n- CORE FINDINGS (MOST IMPORTANT) — Adoption rate: Around 70% of firms actively use AI. [Source: NBER, https://www.nber.org/papers/w34836] ([nber.org](https://www.nber.org/papers/w34836))\\n\\n- CORE FINDINGS — Executive usage: More than two-thirds of top executives regularly use AI; average usage is 1.5 hours per week; about 25% report no AI use. [Source: NBER, https://www.nber.org/papers/w34836] ([nber.org](https://www.nber.org/papers/w34836))\\n\\n- CORE FINDINGS — Current impact: Over 80% of firms report no impact on employment or productivity from AI in the past 3 years. [Source: NBER, https://www.nber.org/papers/w34836] ([nber.org](https://www.nber.org/papers/w34836))\\n\\n- CORE FINDINGS — Near-term projections: Firms forecast productivity up 1.4%, output up 0.8%, and employment down 0.7% over the next 3 years; employees forecast a net employment increase of about 0.5% over the same horizon. [Source: NBER, https://www.nber.org/papers/w34836] ([nber.org](https://www.nber.org/papers/w34836))\\n\\n- CORE FINDINGS — AI category breakdown: Not disclosed in cited sources (no published breakdown by technologies such as text generation, ML data processing, or visual content within the primary report). [Source: NBER, https://www.nber.org/papers/w34836] ([nber.org](https://www.nber.org/papers/w34836))\\n\\n- CORE FINDINGS — Heterogeneity: Adoption is more prevalent among larger, more productive firms. [Source: NBER, https://www.nber.org/papers/w34836] ([nber.org](https://www.nber.org/papers/w34836))\\n\\n- WHAT THIS ACTUALLY MEANS — Near-term ROI clarity: The aggregate productivity gains observed to date are modest, implying substantial ROI requires deliberate complements (training, workflow redesign, governance).
