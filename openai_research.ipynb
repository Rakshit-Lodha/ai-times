TechCrunch explicitly describes the details as coming from leaks and “tipsters,” not an official OpenAI confirmation; Axios likewise characterizes the information as rumors shared at Davos. ([techcrunch.com](https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/21/openai-aims-to-ship-its-first-device-in-2026-and-it-could-be-earbuds/))\\n\\n- Verified: The same reporting that mentions Sweetpea also references a potential second consumer device codenamed Gumdrop in the rumor mill. ([axios.com](https://www.axios.com/2026/01/23/openai-device-earbuds-sweetpea-altman))\\n\\n- Added confirmed hardware context: OpenAI disclosed at Davos that it is building a new AI device, though details remain scarce. Timeline given by OpenAI officials in these discussions points to a likely release in the second half of 2026. ([axios.com](https://www.axios.com/2026/01/23/openai-device-earbuds-sweetpea-altman))\\n\\n- Confirmed: OpenAI’s prior hardware efforts are linked to its 2025 acquisition of Jony Ive’s design firm io (the deal was reported to be around $6.5 billion). Ive is associated with leading the hardware design work for the product family. ([techcrunch.com](https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/21/openai-aims-to-ship-its-first-device-in-2026-and-it-could-be-earbuds/))\\n\\n- Confirmed: OpenAI’s hardware plans discussed publicly have included a screen-free, pocketable device concept as part of the early product narrative. ([techcrunch.com](https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/21/openai-aims-to-ship-its-first-device-in-2026-and-it-could-be-earbuds/))\\n\\n- Confirmed: Reported design descriptions for the Sweetpea concept include a main unit described as metal and egg-shaped, with two pill-shaped modules that would sit behind the ear. These details appear in multiple outlets drawing on the same leaks.

([techcrunch.com](https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/21/openai-aims-to-ship-its-first-device-in-2026-and-it-could-be-earbuds/))\\n\\n- Confirmed (scope/roadmap detail in leaks): Some leakage coverage claims OpenAI is planning a broader hardware roadmap (up to five devices by 2028), with Sweetpea at the front of that lineup. This detail appears in multiple leak-focused outlets. ([androidauthority.com](https://www.androidauthority.com/openai-earbuds-3631925/))\\n\\n- Not corroborated by credible outlets (branding name caveat): The claim that the consumer-facing name will be “Dime” lacks confirmation from established major outlets. Some blogs and tech sites have floated “Dime” as branding based on patent filings or rumor chatter, but there is no widely credited report in outlets like TechCrunch, Axios, or The Indian Express confirming “Dime.” Examples of circulating but less-established sources include Gizmochina and other aggregators.

    "{'headline': 'Legal AI Unicorn Harvey Skyrockets to $11B in 12 Months', 'output': \"Harvey, the legal AI startup founded in 2022, is reportedly raising $200M at an $11B valuation—led by Sequoia and Singapore's GIC. That's a wild jump from $3B (Feb 2025), to $5B (June), $8B (Dec), and now $11B in just one year. The company serves 50 of AmLaw 100 firms across 700 clients in 63 countries, with $190M ARR by end-2025. Four funding rounds in under 12 months signals either explosive traction or frothy AI hype.

Unveiled February 9 in New York, the platform uses proprietary memory architecture to retain conversation history, personality traits, and relationship dynamics across sessions.
