([blog.google](https://blog.google/innovation-and-ai/models-and-research/gemini-models/gemini-3-1-pro/))\\n\\n- Access to 3.1 Pro is available through the Gemini API, Vertex AI, the Gemini app, and NotebookLM. ([blog.google](https://blog.google/innovation-and-ai/models-and-research/gemini-models/gemini-3-1-pro/))\\n\\n- In benchmarking, 3.1 Pro achieved a verified ARC-AGI-2 score of 77.1%, described as more than double the reasoning performance of 3 Pro. ([blog.google](https://blog.google/innovation-and-ai/models-and-research/gemini-models/gemini-3-1-pro/))\\n\\n- Code-based animation capability: 3.1 Pro can generate website-ready, animated SVGs directly from a text prompt. ([blog.google](https://blog.google/innovation-and-ai/models-and-research/gemini-models/gemini-3-1-pro/))\\n\\n- Complex system synthesis example: the model can bridge complex APIs to user-friendly designs, demonstrated by building a live aerospace dashboard that visualizes the ISS orbit. ([blog.google](https://blog.google/innovation-and-ai/models-and-research/gemini-models/gemini-3-1-pro/))\\n\\n- Interactive design example: 3.1 Pro can code a complex 3D starling murmuration with hand-tracking and a generative score that shifts based on movement.
