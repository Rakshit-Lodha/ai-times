    "  'output': '- Medicomp Systems unveiled a Model Context Protocol (MCP) layer to safely expose its APIs to AI models, enabling context-aware, clinically grounded AI workflows (diagnostic prompting, chart summarization, coding crosswalks, etc.). ([medicomp.com](https://medicomp.com/medicomp-systems-unveils-new-ai-enablement-tools-focused-on-delivering-clinically-validated-evidence-based-intelligence/))\\n\\n- The MCP layer grounds AI outputs in Medicomp’s clinical knowledge foundation, leveraging the Quippe Clinical Knowledge Graph and the MEDCIN graph database to enable clinically validated reasoning and prevent unvalidated data from being saved or exchanged. ([medicomp.com](https://medicomp.com/medicomp-systems-unveils-new-ai-enablement-tools-focused-on-delivering-clinically-validated-evidence-based-intelligence/))\\n\\n- Core elements include clinically validating outputs from conversational and ambient AI, recalling and manipulating data in clinical notes via natural language, and converting narrative text into trustworthy structured data across medical domains. ([medicomp.com](https://medicomp.com/medicomp-systems-unveils-new-ai-enablement-tools-focused-on-delivering-clinically-validated-evidence-based-intelligence/))\\n\\n- The MCP architecture aims to reduce variability and risk of unstructured AI output by removing PHI access from large language models and embedding AI interactions within existing clinical workflows. ([medicomp.com](https://medicomp.com/medicomp-systems-unveils-new-ai-enablement-tools-focused-on-delivering-clinically-validated-evidence-based-intelligence/))\\n\\n- Live capabilities highlighted by Medicomp include recalling lab results, filtering entire charts by problem, and analyzing charts against quality measures using voice commands or natural language. ([medicomp.com](https://medicomp.com/medicomp-systems-unveils-new-ai-enablement-tools-focused-on-delivering-clinically-validated-evidence-based-intelligence/))\\n\\n- Medicomp ties these capabilities to its Alchemy product, described as the first tooling to validate, clean, and normalize clinical data at scale, now integrated with MCP-enabled workflows. ([medicomp.com](https://medicomp.com/medicomp-systems-unveils-new-ai-enablement-tools-focused-on-delivering-clinically-validated-evidence-based-intelligence/))\\n\\n- Select MCP-enabled interactions are already live with customers, with broader expansion planned for 2026 and beyond, and live previews scheduled for ViVE 2026 and HIMSS26. ([medicomp.com](https://medicomp.com/medicomp-systems-unveils-new-ai-enablement-tools-focused-on-delivering-clinically-validated-evidence-based-intelligence/))\\n\\n- Quippe’s clinical data foundation rests on MEDCIN’s clinical knowledge graph, which comprises over 430,000 clinical concepts and hundreds of millions of relevancy links, plus about 10 million code mappings, enabling AI-enabled workflows across care domains.
