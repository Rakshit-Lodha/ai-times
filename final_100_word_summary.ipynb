This follows their massive $6.5 billion acquisition of io Products, Jony Ive's design firm. The first product, a camera-equipped smart speaker priced at $200 to $300, won't ship until February 2027 at the earliest, while smart glasses are slated for 2028. This pivot from pure software to physical products puts OpenAI in direct competition with Meta's successful Ray-Ban glasses and upcoming wearables from Apple and Google, as AI companies race to embed intelligence into everyday objects around your home.\",\n",

    "  'output': 'A new NBER study surveying nearly 6,000 executives across the US, UK, Germany, and Australia reveals a striking gap between AI adoption and results. Around 70% of firms actively use AI and two-thirds of executives spend 1.5 hours weekly on it, yet over 80% report no employment or productivity impact over the past three years. Firms forecast 1.4% productivity gains and 0.7% job cuts over the next three years, while employees expect net job growth. The takeaway: substantial ROI demands structured measurement frameworks, workflow redesign, and cross-functional governance, not just tool deployment.',\n",

With new OpenAI offices opening in Mumbai and Bengaluru by 2026, this positions India as a global AI powerhouse while giving enterprises tools to compete in the AI-first economy.\"\n",

    "    \"output\": \"Fractal just launched Vaidya 2.0, a healthcare AI model that's crushing the competition. It scored 50.1 on OpenAI's notoriously tough HealthBench test, becoming the first model to cross 50 and outperforming both GPT-5 and Google's Gemini Pro 3. Think of it as an AI doctor's assistant that can triage emergencies, check symptoms, and guide patients through treatment. Unlike typical AI models that just recall medical facts, Vaidya 2.0 actually reasons through complex healthcare scenarios. Part of India's $1.2 billion AI push, it's designed specifically for healthcare systems in developing regions, bridging the gap between raw patient data and actual medical action.\"\n",

    "    \"output\": \"OpenAI is jumping into consumer hardware with a team of over 200 people developing AI-powered devices, including smart speakers, glasses, and even a smart lamp. This follows their massive $6.5 billion acquisition of io Products, Jony Ive's design firm. The first product, a camera-equipped smart speaker priced at $200 to $300, won't ship until February 2027 at the earliest, while smart glasses are slated for 2028. This pivot from pure software to physical products puts OpenAI in direct competition with Meta's successful Ray-Ban glasses and upcoming wearables from Apple and Google, as AI companies race to embed intelligence into everyday objects around your home.\"\n",

The Alignment Project, a UK-led initiative, now boasts over £27 million in funding supporting roughly 60 research projects across eight countries. OpenAI is chipping in £5.6 million, joining partners like Anthropic, AWS, and Canada's CIFAR. Think of it as a global insurance policy: researchers get grants, computing power, and mentorship to ensure future AI systems don't go rogue. With a second funding round opening this summer, the coalition aims to build public trust and enable safer AI deployment in critical services worldwide.\"\n",

Announced at the India AI Impact Summit, the funds will flow into AI, healthcare, defense tech, fintech, and consumer startups. GC isn't chasing cutting-edge AI model development. Instead, it's betting on deploying AI solutions at scale in the real world, where India's vast market shines.

It scored 77.1% on the ARC-AGI-2 benchmark, literally doubling the reasoning power of its predecessor. The upgrade rolls out today across the Gemini app, NotebookLM, API, and enterprise tools. What makes it wild? It can generate animated website code from text, build live aerospace dashboards tracking the ISS, and even code 3D bird simulations with hand-tracking. This positions Google to compete harder in agentic AI workflows where models actually solve multi-step problems autonomously, not just chat.\"\n",

The system will be hosted entirely in India with full data sovereignty, meaning all your data stays within national borders under Indian governance. Once live, universities, startups, SMEs, and government ministries get access to this beast.
